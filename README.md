#### **Additional Integrations**:
- **Stripe/PayPal**: For handling payments (optional for monetization)
- **GitHub/GitLab APIs**: For repository integration
- **Google Calendar API**: For scheduling and syncing events
- **WebRTC/Zoom API**: For video calls between mentors and teams

### **3. Core Features**

#### **3.1 User Registration & Authentication**
- **User Roles**: Admins, Organizers, Participants, Judges, and Mentors
- **Sign-in Methods**: Google, GitHub, LinkedIn, Email/Password
- **Security**: Firebase Authentication handles session management and role-based access control (RBAC).
  
**How-to Implement**:
1. Configure Firebase Authentication.
2. Set up RBAC by defining custom roles within Firestore rules.
3. Use Firebase UI for custom login pages.

#### **3.2 Team Creation & Management**
- **Dynamic Team Formation**: Users can create or join teams, set roles (leader, member), and track their team’s progress.
- **Team Dashboard**: Each team has a dedicated space for task management, file sharing, and communication.
- **Real-time Collaboration**: Use Firebase Firestore to sync updates across all team members in real time.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Create Firestore collections for "teams", "tasks", and "team members".
2. Use Firestore’s real-time sync to keep team dashboards updated.
3. Add team invites and permissions logic to allow leaders to manage team members.

#### **3.3 Organizer Dashboard**
- **Hackathon Setup**: Organizers can create new hackathons with custom submission timelines, evaluation criteria, and categories.
- **Participant Management**: View participant lists, assigned teams, and their respective statuses.
- **Submission Management**: Define different phases (idea, prototype, final submission) and track team progress.
- **Evaluation Management**: Set up judge panels, evaluation rubrics, and scoring methods.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Use Firebase Firestore to store hackathon details, timelines, and criteria.
2. Build an admin dashboard for organizers using React/Angular components to manage settings.
3. Create backend logic with Firebase Cloud Functions to automate the handling of deadlines and evaluation notifications.

#### **3.4 Submissions and Progress Tracking**
- **Multi-Stage Submissions**: Teams can submit files at different stages (e.g., idea, prototype, final). Submissions are stored in Firebase Storage.
- **Version Control**: Teams can update their submissions while maintaining previous versions.
- **Task Tracking**: Use Firebase to maintain a list of assigned tasks and their progress in real time.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Create submission forms and file upload components in the frontend.
2. Use Firebase Storage to store files securely, and Firestore to track metadata (submission date, version history).
3. Design task assignment forms for each team’s dashboard, connected to Firestore.

#### **3.5 Real-Time Notifications**
- **Push Notifications**: Use Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) to send notifications for deadlines, announcements, or updates.
- **Custom Alerts**: Organizers can send important updates or reminders directly to participants or teams.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Set up Firebase Cloud Messaging in your app.
2. Use Cloud Functions to send notifications based on triggers like submission deadlines or evaluation results.

#### **3.6 Judging & Evaluation**
- **Custom Evaluation Criteria**: Organizers can define scoring rubrics and assign judges to specific teams or tracks.
- **Real-Time Leaderboard**: Automatic leaderboard updates based on judges' scores.
- **Anonymous Judging**: Option to anonymize submissions to ensure fairness.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Build forms for judges to submit scores and feedback.
2. Store the evaluations in Firestore, and calculate real-time scores to update the leaderboard.
3. Add a setting for anonymous judging that hides team names during evaluations.

#### **3.7 Mentorship & Guidance**
- **Mentor Assignments**: Mentors can be assigned to teams, allowing them to provide feedback and guidance.
- **Mentor-Participant Chat**: Real-time chat using Firestore or Firebase Realtime Database.
- **Video Calls**: Use WebRTC or Zoom API for scheduled mentor-team calls.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Set up mentor assignment logic in Firestore.
2. Implement chat features using Firestore for real-time messages.
3. Integrate WebRTC or Zoom API for video calls.

#### **3.8 Post-Hackathon Showcase**
- **Project Gallery**: Showcase all submissions with descriptions, images, and live demos.
- **Rating & Commenting**: Allow users or mentors to rate and comment on projects.
- **Archive Past Hackathons**: Store previous hackathon data, including teams, projects, and evaluations.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Use Firestore to store and display submission metadata (e.g., project details, team information).
2. Implement rating and commenting features, storing reviews in Firestore.
3. Design an archive section for past hackathons, using filters and sorting options.

#### **3.9 Payment Integration (Optional)**
- **Monetization**: Option to charge participants an entry fee, using **Stripe** or **PayPal** for secure payment processing.
- **Sponsor Banners**: Organizers can showcase sponsors with ads or banners on the platform.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Integrate Stripe or PayPal payment gateway into the registration form.
2. Store payment details securely in Firestore for organizers to track.

#### **3.10 Advanced Analytics**
- **Engagement Metrics**: Track participant activity, submission rates, and team progress.
- **Event Insights**: Display insights for organizers to assess participation and engagement levels.
- **Leaderboards**: Real-time leaderboard showing top teams based on evaluation scores.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Use Firebase Analytics to track user interactions.
2. Display analytics via custom dashboards in the admin panel.
3. Integrate real-time leaderboards using Firestore for dynamic updates.

### **4. Security Considerations**
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Secure different user roles using Firebase Authentication and Firestore security rules.
- **Data Privacy**: Ensure that submissions, evaluations, and participant data are stored securely and are only accessible to authorized users.
- **File Upload Security**: Ensure file uploads are scanned for malware or improper formats.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Set up Firestore security rules to limit data access based on roles.
2. Use Firebase Storage rules to restrict access to sensitive files (e.g., only judges can access submissions).

### **5. Deployment & Hosting**
- **Hosting**: Use **Firebase Hosting** for deploying the web application.
- **CI/CD**: Set up continuous integration/continuous deployment (CI/CD) using GitHub Actions or Firebase CLI.
- **Domain Setup**: Configure custom domains for your hackathon platform using Firebase Hosting settings.

**How-to Implement**:
1. Deploy the frontend using Firebase Hosting.
2. Automate builds and deployments using GitHub Actions.
3. Set up SSL and custom domains for secure, branded access.

### **6. Future Enhancements**
- **Mobile App**: Develop a mobile version using Flutter or React Native for on-the-go access to hackathons.
- **AI-Powered Team Matching**: Use machine learning algorithms to recommend ideal teams based on participants' skills and interests.
- **Gamification**: Introduce badges, achievements, and rewards to increase participant engagement.
